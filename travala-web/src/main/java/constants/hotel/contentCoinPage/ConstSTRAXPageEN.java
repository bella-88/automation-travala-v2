Stratis’ blockchain-as-a-service BaaS solution comprises a distributed and fully decentralized environment secured by Stratis Sidechain Masternodes, dispersed around the world and configured in a trustless manner.";
    public static final String CONST_STRAX_FAQ_CONTENT2 ="Through the employment of an alternate consensus algorithm known as Proof-of-Authority, Stratis‘ BaaS technology can scale and handle far greater throughput than other public blockchain solutions. A defined set of distributed block producers ensure transactions are validated and processed rapidly, resulting in lightning–fast turnaround times. Stratis’ solution provides the ability to ‘Scale at Will‘ and thus does not experience congestion, resulting in pre-defined and known transactional costs, removing the risk of experiencing volatile costs when interacting with the blockchain.";
    public static final String CONST_STRAX_FAQ_CONTENT3 ="Stratis was one of the first within the blockchain space to fully integrate trustless cross-chain support through its Smart Contract Sidechain(s). Unlike other cross-blockchain solutions that rely upon a centralized service to handle cross-chain transaction requests, Stratis’ implementation is wholly decentralized and trustless, with transactions being conducted in an autonomous and unbiased manner. Stratis InterFlux builds on top of this well-established feature within the Stratis Blockchain Technologies framework.";
