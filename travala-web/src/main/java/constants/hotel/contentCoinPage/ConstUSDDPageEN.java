    public static final String CONST_USDD_FAQ_CONTENT1 ="USDD is minted by the whitelisted institutions of the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR) through burning TRX. Its value is backed by the over-collateralization of highly liquid crypto assets under the TDR, including BTC, USDT, USDC, and TRX. The circulation and use of USDD are free from the intervention of any centralized parties. Similar to BTC and ETH, USDD grants its holders full ownership, meaning that no organization or individual has access to freeze users’ USDD.";
    public static final String CONST_USDD_FAQ_CONTENT2 ="USDD’s price stability is maintained by a basket of monetary policies adopted by the TDR and backed by its reserve assets. As long as the TDR holds a sufficient and healthy reserve, the price of USDD is stable. The details of the TDR’s reserve assets are published in real-time on TRON DAO Reserve. As of now, the collateralization ratio is over 310%. Even under the extreme circumstance when the value of TRX reaches zero, the remaining reserve assets worth $1.4 billion are still double the value of USDD in circulation. Therefore, the TDR reserve can provide sufficient and healthy liquidity for the stability of USDD.";
    public static final String CONST_USDD_FAQ_CONTENT3 ="The goal of monetary policies is to maintain USDD’s price stability and drive the growth of the TRON ecosystem. This is done by implementing four key monetary policy instruments:  1. Setting interest rates: The initial benchmark interest rate for USDD is 30% and is slightly higher on platforms that recently listed USDD, all subsidized by the TDR to acquire new users and drive up its adoption. 2. Open market operations: Through buying or selling USDD and reserve assets, including TRX, BTC, USDT, and USDC on CEXs or DEXs, the TDR manages to keep USDD’s price stable. 3. Window guidance: In times of severe market turbulence, the TDR will partner with crypto institutions to limit the amount of USDD and TRX lent or even temporarily pause the lending of USDD and TRX to crack down on malicious short-sellers. 4. Minting-burning mechanism of TRX and USDD: The TDR employs methods such as enabling or disabling the minting process, adjusting the mint-burn ratio, and imposing upper limits on daily minting and burning activities.";
