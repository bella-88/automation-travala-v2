         public static final String CONST_DOT_WHAT_IS_CONTENT ="Founded in 2016, Polkadot is a blockchain protocol that connects an entire network of purpose-built blockchains, allowing them to operate seamlessly together at scale. Described as a “blockchain of blockchains”, Polkadot is designed to ‘join the dots’ of other networks by enabling users to build, host, and connect blockchains. Polkadot’s aim is to act as a framework for all blockchains, so developer time, talent, and resources can be dedicated elsewhere.";
         public static final String CONST_DOT_MISSION_CONTENT ="Polkadot believes there should be “Less Trust More Truth”. They envision a web where a user’s identity and data is their own - safely secured from any central authority. To do this, Polkadot plans to enable a completely decentralized web where users are in control. In doing so, they seek to free society from its reliance on a broken web where large institutions can violate user trust.";

A parachain works by attaching to the security provided by a Relay Chain rather than providing its own. By doing this, all parachains benefit from the Relay Chain’s base features.";
         public static final String CONST_DOT_FAQ_CONTENT2 ="The heart of Polkadot, the Relay Chain, is responsible for coordinating the system as a whole. This includes the network’s shared security, consensus and cross-chain interoperability.
