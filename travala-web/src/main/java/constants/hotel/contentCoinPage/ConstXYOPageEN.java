Sentinels get paid in XYO Tokens to geomine valuable verified location data, Archivists get paid to store that information, and Diviners must pay the Sentinels and Archivists in XYO Tokens should they want to access the data for a use.

    public static final String CONST_XYO_FAQ_CONTENT1 ="Geomining is the way XY community members can actively become a part of the XYO Network. Geomining kits come with XYO Sentinels and a Bridge component. XYO Sentinels allow you to collect/create location data that is related to the XYO Network. The Bridge component allows you to share those collected and verified locations to the XYO Network, so they can be stored later for queries. When that information and verified location data is used in a query in the XYO Network, then you earn XYO tokens.";
    public static final String CONST_XYO_FAQ_CONTENT2 ="XYO is building the world’s first truly \"Dataistic\" Network. The project is focused on building a network that can collect different kinds of data—temperature, location, speed, humidity, and more—and then allow the project to not only profit off the data we provide, but also find better ways to utilize and benefit from all that data.";
    public static final String CONST_XYO_FAQ_CONTENT3 ="Instead of your mining equipment performing calculations for transactions, your mining equipment performs “bound witnesses”. People who want to use that data then pay XYO tokens to get them. You own devices which can be used as nodes (network components). There are two different \"edge\" nodes, which are called sentinels and bridges. Sentinels create bound witnesses, bridges collect and upload bound witnesses to XYO Network. A lot of devices can work as both kinds of edge node, meaning that they can create bound witnesses and then upload them.";
