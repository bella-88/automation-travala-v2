    public static final String CONST_XLM_FAQ_CONTENT1 ="Stellar is an open-source network optimized for payments and asset issuance. On Stellar, you can create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of value, including U.S. dollars, Argentine pesos, Bitcoin, real estate, and almost anything else. It’s designed so all the world’s financial systems can freely interoperate with each other, all on a single network.";
    public static final String CONST_XLM_FAQ_CONTENT2 ="Every token on Stellar is exchangeable with any other token on the network, and the protocol itself connects buyers and sellers. Users can submit their bids or asks to the public network via a single, simple operation, and compatible trades will automatically resolve every few seconds. No intermediary arranges settlement, and no entity acts as an intermediate custodian all due to the decentralized exchange (a.k.a. a DEX) built into Stellar. Among blockchains, Stellar is unique in this regard. Its protocol not only tracks balances (as Bitcoin or Ethereum do), but also tracks and settles trades between balances in a decentralized, ownerless way.";
    public static final String CONST_XLM_FAQ_CONTENT3 ="No. The old Stellar network launched in July 2014. The node software (stellard) was a modified fork of the Ripple node software (“rippled”). The ledger was completely new and contained no history from Ripple’s network. In September 2015, the current Stellar network was launched with a new consensus model (SCP) and software, stellar-core. stellar-core was written from scratch — it does not share any code with rippled.";
