    public static final String CONST_JASMY_FAQ_CONTENT1 ="The project comprises several mechanisms that work together in conjunction. (1) The Data Marketplace itself, which is a marketplace that enables individuals and businesses to securely exchange data. (2) The Secure Knowledge Communicator is a distributed user authentication system, which provides Personal Data Lockers to users. (3) The Smart Guardian allows easy and secure registration of IoT devices to the JasmyCoin network. (4) JasmyNet is a data network in which only authorised member companies of the consortium can participate.";
    public static final String CONST_JASMY_FAQ_CONTENT2 ="The Personal Data Locker is a “content addressing” solution that allows secure storage of files within the P2P network. Data files are stored within the decentralised network while only hash values are managed on the blockchain. By combining this decentralised storage solution in conjunction with the user-owned IDs, the weaknesses of a pure blockchain system—for example, the incapability of storing large files in a single block or the slow-down of approval speed due to large size of files—are solved.  Through the Personal Data Locker, users can manage their own data, like a wallet or a safety deposit box. With Jasmy’s original blockchain technology, data cannot be tampered with or stolen, and the process of data usage can be tracked.";
    public static final String CONST_JASMY_FAQ_CONTENT3 ="As the number of IoT devices increases, manufacturers from a wide variety of industries including home appliance, housing, energy suppliers and telecommunication companies are accelerating their businesses to realise smart home services. Data generated from network-enabled domestic devices is customised by users according to their own lifestyle, including shopping, childcare, nursing, and working environment. Therefore, it is important to have rules and regulations in place for the protection of personal data on these networks.  The project aims to provide IoT solutions for manufacturers and home builders who are expected to enter the smart home market with products such as smart interphones, security cameras, and smart keys, with low-cost and advanced security functions, supported by SG and IoT modules.";
