           public static final String CONST_NEAR_WHAT_IS_CONTENT ="NEAR Protocol is a smart contract capable, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain designed as a community-run cloud computing platform and host for decentralised applications (dApps). NEAR’s native token is also called NEAR, and is used to pay for transaction fees and storage.";
       public static final String CONST_NEAR_MISSION_CONTENT ="NEAR Protocol’s mission is to “make crypto and blockchain effortless to understand and use”. To help achieve this, they’ve incorporated features like human-readable account names and the ability for new users to interact with dApps and smart contracts without requiring a wallet at all.";
       public static final String CONST_NEAR_TEAM_CONTENT ="Work on the NEAR Protocol began at the end of 2018 and has since grown to more than fifty people, including former employees of Facebook, Google and Niantic. ";

       public static final String CONST_NEAR_MORE_USE_CONTENT1 ="NEAR Protocol is a scalable smart contract platform that supports decentralised applications of almost any kind.

The remainder of each transaction fee is burned, increasing the scarcity of the NEAR token.";
       public static final String CONST_NEAR_MORE_USE_CONTENT2 ="NEAR token holders can delegate their tokens to earn rewards. By staking your tokens, you help to secure the network and earn rewards. When you delegate your tokens, you are depositing your token with a specific staking pool that has been deployed by a validator. The amount of staking rewards you can earn is proportionate to the total amount of tokens staked to the network.";
       public static final String CONST_NEAR_MORE_USE_CONTENT3 ="The NEAR governance protocol is unique as resource distribution is not handled by the platform’s Decentralised Autonomous Organisation. Instead, the NEAR Foundation is entrusted with this obligation. The non-profit organisation is in charge of protocol maintenance, ecosystem funding, and protocol governance. NEAR has a dedicated governance forum for community input.";
