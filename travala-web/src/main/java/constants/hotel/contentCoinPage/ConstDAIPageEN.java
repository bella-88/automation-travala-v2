Anyone can submit proposals for an MKR vote, not just MKR holders.  The governance mechanism of the Maker Protocol is designed to be as flexible as possible, and upgradeable. Should the system mature under the guidance of the community, more advanced forms of proposals could, in theory, be used.";
    public static final String CONST_DAI_FAQ_CONTENT2 ="The Dai Savings Rate (DSR) is a global system parameter that determines the amount Dai holders earn on their savings over time. When the market price of Dai deviates from the target price due to changing market dynamics, MKR holders can mitigate the price instability by voting to modify the DSR accordingly.  If the market price of Dai is above (below) 1 USD, MKR holders can choose to gradually decrease (increase) the DSR, which will reduce (stimulate) demand and should reduce (increase) the market price of Dai toward the 1 USD Target Price.";
    public static final String CONST_DAI_FAQ_CONTENT3 ="In addition to its smart contract infrastructure, the Maker Protocol involves groups of external actors to maintain operations: Keepers, Oracles and Global Settlers (Emergency Oracles), and Maker community members. Keepers take advantage of the economic incentives presented by the Protocol; Oracles and Global Settlers are external actors with special permissions in the system assigned to them by MKR voters; and Maker community members are individuals and organisations that provide services.";
