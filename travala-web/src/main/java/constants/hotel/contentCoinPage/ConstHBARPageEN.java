    public static final String CONST_HBAR_WHAT_IS_CONTENT ="Hedera is a fully open source public distributed ledger that utilises the fast, fair, and secure hashgraph consensus. Their network services include Solidity-based smart contracts, as well as native tokenization, and consensus services used to build decentralised applications.";
    public static final String CONST_HBAR_MISSION_CONTENT ="Hedera’s mission is to become “the most decentralised public permissionless ledger in the market”, which they plan to achieve through a combination of “path to permissionless” network nodes and the “path to widespread coin distribution” HBAR cryptocurrency which keeps the network secure.";

    public static final String CONST_HBAR_USE_CASE_CONTENT1 ="Developers use HBARs to pay for network services, such as transferring HBARs, minting fungible and non-fungible tokens, calling smart contracts, and logging data. For every transaction submitted to the network, HBARs are used to pay fees that compensate validator nodes for bandwidth, compute, and storage.";
    public static final String CONST_HBAR_USE_CASE_CONTENT2 ="When HBARs are staked to network nodes, they have a weighted influence on consensus for validating transactions. Weighted voting makes it difficult and expensive for a bad actor to maliciously affect consensus — it would require a centralised authority to own and stake over one-third of the network’s total supply of HBAR.";
