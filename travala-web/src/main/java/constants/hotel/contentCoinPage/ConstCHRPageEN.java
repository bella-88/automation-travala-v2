    public static final String CONST_CHR_WHAT_IS_CONTENT ="Chromia is an open source public blockchain platform that enables decentralized apps (dApps) to be built and used. Chromia provides developers with a variety of tools to create dApps which can function on a private, public, or hybrid blockchain.";
    public static final String CONST_CHR_MISSION_CONTENT ="Chromia’s mission is to make it easy for people to build dApps in the real world, for a better world.";

    public static final String CONST_CHR_USE_CASE_ITEM_TITLE4="Travel";
    public static final String CONST_CHR_USE_CASE_CONTENT1 ="Similar to how tokens are used in Ethereum to pay transaction fees and compensate block producers, CHR is used in Chromia to compensate block-producing nodes. In Chromia, fees are paid in CHR by dApps, though dApp developers are free to implement any policy they want, including collecting fees from users. Projects can also use CHR as reserves to peg their own tokens.";
    public static final String CONST_CHR_USE_CASE_CONTENT2 ="Chromia offers several node classes based on resources allocated for an application to cater for the varying needs of dApps. The application hosting fee is paid in CHR by developers and is split into three components: percentage of processing time, number of transactions, and storage.";
    public static final String CONST_CHR_USE_CASE_CONTENT3 ="CHR is used to make sure that providers have a stake in the Chromia ecosystem, offsetting incentives to collude. The locked CHR represents the provider’s stake in the Chromia economy and is used as collateral which is forfeited when nodes owned by a provider misbehave.";
    public static final String CONST_CHR_USE_CASE_CONTENT4 ="At Travala.com, we offer more than 3,000,000 travel products in over 230 countries available for purchase with CHR.

Alex Mizrahi was also involved in this internet startup, and shortly after the appearance, Alex discovered Bitcoin.

    public static final String CONST_CHR_FAQ_CONTENT1 ="Chromia uses relational databases and the platform’s Rell programming language, which is deliberately similar to modern programming languages like JavaScript and Kotlin, making it simple to learn. Rell is also more efficient than many other blockchain languages as it permits fewer lines of code, allowing developers to code 7-10 times faster.";
    public static final String CONST_CHR_FAQ_CONTENT2 ="Projects that have been built on Chromia include Hedget, Lingon, Green Assets Wallet, LAC PropertyChain, and games such as My Neighbor Alice, Mines of Dalarnia, and Chain of Alliance.";
    public static final String CONST_CHR_FAQ_CONTENT3 ="Providers can group nodes into units with different levels of stake: high, medium, low. High-stake nodes should be more thoroughly secured as they can be used for applications highly sensitive to security, such as running system blockchains and high-volume financial dApps. Low-stake nodes can be used for less sensitive dApps, such as simple games. Each dApp can specify a minimal stake which is required for nodes which run it. The stake level necessary for system blockchains is set by a council of providers.";
