Our Website will subsequently be updated accordingly to reflect the accurate availability, information, and price of the Travel Product(s). In some cases, the price of a Travel Product may change between the time that you select the Travel Product and the time when you attempt to complete the purchase of your Booking. If a change of this nature occurs, we will take reasonable measures to ensure that you are aware of this change before you purchase the Booking. Please note that we are under no obligation to provide you with a reimbursement or refund of any kind if the price of a Travel Product becomes lower following the successful completion of your Booking.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT36=3.1 In order to use some aspects of the Services, including to successfully purchase a Booking, you will be required to create a Travala Account.

TERM_SUB_CONTENT39=4.1 Our staff may be able to assist you with information pertaining to passports, visas, and other travel documents you may require for your trip. Please be aware that, while we can assist in providing this information to you, the information that we provide is general in nature and it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that you have the relevant documents required for your trip. Any penalties, fines or additional expenses incurred as a result of the failure to obtain these documents will be incurred solely by you (subject to our liability).
TERM_SUB_CONTENT40=4.2 Any customer who successfully purchases a Booking for a flight with a Carrier must have a valid passport. We assume that a valid passport is held by every person included in the Booking. If any of the travellers does not have a valid passport, you must Contact Us immediately. Please be aware that, in addition to holding a valid passport, your passport is required by many countries to be valid for at least six (6) months from the date of return, and some countries may require passports to be machine-readable. In addition to ensuring that all parties in the Booking have a valid passport, all parties must also obtain visas and re-entry permits that satisfy immigration requirements and any other relevant laws, including for countries that you may only be transiting through.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT41=4.3 If you have any special requirements, such as dietary requirements, seating arrangements, disabled access, or any other special requests, please make these requests during the Booking process (if available) or Contact Us immediately following the purchase of your Booking to allow as much time as possible for your requirements to be met. Please note that, while we will endeavour to accommodate your request(s), we cannot guarantee that your request(s) will be honoured by the Service Provider.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT42=5.1 Your Travel Document(s) will be delivered to you electronically to the email address provided by you at the time of your Booking. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that the email address you provide is entered correctly and that you will immediately notify us where an error has been made on your part. We shall not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver your Travel Document(s) where the delay or failure was made on your part. The Service Provider or other relevant authorities may require you to present any of the following documents in either electronic or printed format: your itinerary/e-ticket(s), boarding pass(es), visa(s), passport, or any other relevant document.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT43=5.2 Certain conditions or restrictions may be imposed on Travel Documents, such as being non-refundable or subject to amendment or cancellation fees. Please ensure that you carefully read each Travel Document upon its receipt to ensure that it is in order.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT44=5.3 Travel Documents are non-transferable. Where a Booking for a flight with a Carrier is purchased, the Travel Document must be issued in the name of the passport/photo identity holder.

If there is a mistake on your Travel Document, such as an incorrect name or date of birth, please Contact Us immediately.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT45=5.4 Any health requirements or precautions associated with your trip are your responsibility. Please ensure that you have any relevant vaccination documentation if you are travelling to a country requiring proof of vaccination. It is also generally good practice to visit your general practitioner or vaccination clinic before your trip to see if any vaccinations are required for your travel.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT46=6.1 Unforeseen circumstances may arise when travelling. For this reason, it is recommended that you consider whether you require travel insurance, especially for international travel. It is recommended that your travel insurance cover medical expenses, personal injury, death, loss of luggage, loss of money, cancellation, and personal liability insurance. Please note that we do not sell travel insurance, though we may be able to provide you with general information regarding travel insurance. We shall bear no liability for the general information that we provide or for your purchase or non-purchase of travel insurance.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT47=6.2 General travel advice and country-specific travel advice is provided by most countries. While we may be able to provide general information to you in relation to country-specific travel advice, we make no representations as to the accuracy of this information and shall bear no liability for any resulting damages. By purchasing a Booking, we assume that your country of departure permits you to visit the destination of your Booking or any transits in between. We shall bear no liability for any cancellation fees or other fees that you may incur as a result of your inability to use your Booking.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT48=7.1 Your price will only be guaranteed once the Total Price for your Booking has been paid in full. Please note that taxes are subject to change and the tax is finalised when your Travel Document is issued. You also acknowledge that TRAVALA.com is not subject to VAT, and therefore no VAT invoice will be issued to you following the successful completion of your Booking.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT49=7.2 We accept payment via selected cryptocurrencies, selected credit and debit cards, bank wire transfers, and other methods (collectively \u201CPayment Method\u201D). Please see our Payment Options for an up-to-date list of current options.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT50=7.3 Cryptocurrency Payments. A Booking purchased with cryptocurrency will only be ticketed once the transaction has received one (1) confirmation on the relevant blockchain. Bookings purchased with cryptocurrency are generally subject to miner fees, which are received by miners (or nodes) that confirm your transaction on the blockchain, not TRAVALA.com. The miner fee applicable to your Booking will depend on network conditions and the miner fee selected by you at the time of the cryptocurrency transaction. Please further take note of our cryptocurrency refund policy in clause 8.6 herein.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT51=7.4 Credit and Debit Cards. By agreeing to these Terms, you authorise us to charge your designated credit or debit card for all fees incurred by you in relation to the Services provided by us. Please note that a surcharge may be incurred on credit and debit card payments. The applicable surcharge will be displayed to you prior to the completion of your Booking. By purchasing a Booking using a credit or debit card, you acknowledge that we will not be liable for any additional costs you incur associated with exchange rates, bank fees, credit card fees or debit card fees. For clarity, TRAVALA.com will not refund any such charge to your credit card, debit card, or Travala Wallet.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT52=7.5 We reserve the right to delegate the management of all or part of our electronic payment collection (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, cryptocurrencies) to our subsidiaries or third-party payment providers. Any fees incurred by you as a result of purchasing a Travel Product from us are non-refundable, subject to your rights under applicable law.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT53=7.6 You agree that our payment providers can securely store your payment details, which can subsequently be used by us for later payment or refunds of your Booking. Upon submitting your Booking form, you authorise us to facilitate reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with Service Providers and any third parties related to the provision of your Booking.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT54=7.7 For payments made online via the Website, you will not pay the Service Provider for the Travel Product mentioned on the Travel Document. Only Bookings made using direct payment with a Service Provider (e.g. in person at a hotel) will allow you to pay for your reservation once you arrive at the establishment. These two distinct payment options are clearly displayed during the Booking process.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT55=7.8 For Bookings made via a TRAVALA.com employee, a deposit (or deposits) may be required. The amount of the deposit and number of deposits (for multiple Bookings) will be communicated to you via a TRAVALA.com employee. Should an amendment or cancellation be made by you, your deposit(s) may be forfeited (subject to your rights under applicable law). Since final payments for Bookings with Service Providers are variable, we will advise you when final payment for your Booking is due.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT56=7.9 Exceptionally, TRAVALA.com may, at sole discretion, offer you the option to pay a low deposit for certain Bookings with Accommodation Providers (\u201CEarly Booking\u201D). This will be indicated next to the specific Travel Product in your search results. An Early Booking requires a partial payment at the time of reservation and confirmation and a secondary payment consisting of the total balance due at a future point in time, as communicated on TRAVALA.com and in your confirmation email. The later payment will be automatically collected on the due date. You must make sure that the Payment Method is valid and has enough funds at the time of the balance payment. In case the Payment Method cannot be charged for whatever reason, you can pay the remaining balance using a valid Payment Method. If the payment is not authorised in due time, the Booking will be cancelled.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT57=7.10 If your chosen Travel Product is not available and we provide you with an alternative option, your Payment Method will only be charged if you accept the new Travel Product and the new rate offered. If you do not accept the given alternative, no charge will be made to your Payment Method by TRAVALA.com.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT58=7.11 Any personal information that you submit to us in relation to the purchase of your Booking will be protected by our secure SSL payment gateway server, which uses 256-bit security technology to protect your online order information. This technology encrypts all information and all personal information passed from you through our Website.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT59=8.1 The applicable cancellation policy of the Travel Product (except in the instance of flights notwithstanding the definition of a Travel Product defined herein) is displayed prior to your completion of the online Booking form. Please ensure that you read the cancellation policy applicable to your selected Travel Product carefully as the cancellation policy varies between Service Providers and the respective Travel Products that are offered. Any cancellation of a flight Booking shall be subject to the Service Provider/Carrier\u2019s cancellation terms/policy.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT60=8.2 Voluntary changes for flight bookings can only be requested up to 72 hours before departure. If you voluntarily cancel or make changes to your Booking, the Service Provider may charge a cancellation or change fee. Voluntary cancellations or changes to Bookings cannot be reversed once requested by you. Where a change or cancellation to a Booking is made, processing fees may be applied by us in addition to the charges imposed by the Service Provider. If your flight booking contains multiple passengers, any changes you make will apply to the itinerary of all passengers relevant to that Booking; if you wish to change the Booking for some (not all) passengers, you acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility to make these arrangements directly with the Carrier. Please be aware that some Bookings may be non-refundable, and in this instance we cannot provide you with a refund. Where you request a voluntary cancellation on a Booking that may be refundable, please be aware that we cannot calculate the refund amount that you will receive at the time of your cancellation request. If you arrive late on your scheduled Booking date (as stated on your Travel Document), decide to leave before the conclusion of the Travel Product (as stated on your Travel Document), or fail to arrive (no-show), TRAVALA.com will not issue any refunds. Please note that, in some cases, you may be charged for the cancellation fee in accordance with the Service Provider\u2019s cancellation policy if the amendment is made after a certain date or falls under an exception. When you cancel a flight Booking, the Booking will be cancelled for all passengers booked under the same Booking.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT61=8.3 If your Booking is cancelled or changed by the Service Provider or a related third party, we will endeavour to notify you of the corresponding cancellation or change as soon as possible. Please note that we are not liable for the consequences of any cancellations or changes made by these third parties.
TERM_SUB_CONTENT62=8.4 If you wish to modify the dates of your Booking with an Accommodation Provider, please log in to your Travala Account and use the "Change my dates" form subject to the Booking term allowing for such changes. For other types of modifications to Bookings with Accommodation Providers, or to modify Bookings with Carriers or Activity Providers, please Contact Us subject to a Booking that allows modifications.

In rare cases, we may also have to cancel or reject a Booking due to \u201Cobvious errors\u201D, independent of the origin of such errors. For clarity, an obvious error is a mistake on the Website (e.g. in terms of price) which a reasonable person would not consider to be normal. The amount charged will be reimbursed without charge in such case. Whether to cancel or reject a Booking for this reason is in TRAVALA.com\u2019s sole discretion.

NFT_TERM_CONTENT26=YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) ANY PORTION OF THE PLATFORM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE ACTUALLY AND LAWFULLY PAID US UNDER THESE TERMS IN THE TWO (2) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE.
NFT_TERM_CONTENT27=YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE PLATFORM AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN US AND YOU AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US AND YOU. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PLATFORM TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
NFT_TERM_CONTENT28=You agree to hold harmless and indemnify us and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost and attorneys' fees arising out of or in any way related to: (i) your breach of these Terms; (ii) your misuse of the Platform; or (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the Platform. You agree that we will have control of the defense or settlement of any such claims.
NFT_TERM_CONTENT29=The Platform may include hyperlinks to other websites or resources (collectively, the \u201CExternal Sites\u201D), which are provided solely as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or made available from or through any External Sites. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.
NFT_TERM_CONTENT30=We are constantly innovating the Platform to help provide the best possible experience. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Platform, and any part of it, may change from time to time without prior notice to you, and that we may add new features and change any part of the Platform at any time without notice.
NFT_TERM_CONTENT31=You affirm that you are over the age of 18. The Platform is not intended for children under 18. If you are under the age of 18, you may not use the Platform. We do not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under the age of 18. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 18, we will unfortunately have to close your account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use the Platform.
NFT_TERM_CONTENT32=Our Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
NFT_TERM_CONTENT33=All rights and obligations hereunder in connection with the Collectibles shall be governed by the Laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions of such jurisdiction. The parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Cayman Islands and any courts competent to hear appeals from those courts.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT1=Account and Wallet Set-Up. To most easily use the Platform, you should follow the instructions on the Platform’s website, which is available at https://www.travala.com/. You will also need to use a supported electronic wallet, which will enable you to purchase and store Collectibles that you collect or purchase via the Platform. Each Collectible is a Non-Fungible Token (an “NFT”) on the Ethereum blockchain network (the “Network”). Each Collectible is part of a collection of unique, randomly generated NFTs released on the Network. Each NFT is unique and is the key to the Smart Diamond Membership on the Platform.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT2=Account Registration. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the Platform. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update your account information as necessary. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames without liability to you.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT3=Account Security. You are responsible for the security of your account for the Platform and for your electronic wallets. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at support@travala.com.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT4=Account Transactions. You can use your electronic wallet to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using one or more cryptocurrencies that we may elect to accept from time to time. Transactions that take place on the Platform are managed and confirmed via the Network. You understand that your public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Platform.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT5=Acquiring Collectibles. The Platform allows certain select persons to purchase a Collectible and to enjoy the membership benefits as determined by us from time to time when the Collectible is held in conjunction with a specific travel loyalty rewards program membership available on the Platform (the \u201CSmart Program\u201D), subject to the Smart Program and Wallet Terms and Conditions. Each Collectible is an NFT on the Network. For the avoidance of doubt, purchasing the Collectible(s) in itself does not carry or provide the buyer/holder of the Collectibles with any membership benefits, and any membership benefits shall be subject to the buyer/holder of the Collectible(s) satisfying the requirements set out in the Smart Program and Wallet Terms and Conditions.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT6=Purchasing Collectibles. If you meet the qualification requirements set out at https://www.travala.com/nft then you can purchase a Collectible through the Platform. We are not undertaking a public sale of the Collectibles and only certain persons will be eligible to purchase a Collectible from us. You may also be able to purchase a Collectible from other users of the Platform on one or more third-party marketplaces (each a “Marketplace”). If you purchase a Collectible from us then it will be selected at random. If you buy an individual Collectible from another user on a Marketplace, then you may be able to know the exact Collectible that you are purchasing. If you decide to purchase a Collectible through a Marketplace or in any manner other than through us then you understand that such purchases will be entirely at your sole risk. 
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT7=Characteristics of Collectibles. Collectibles consist of “Travel Tiger” artwork that comes from a collection of unique, randomly generated NFTs. The value of the Collectible on a Marketplace (if any) may be determined by the Marketplace users, which may be based on the popularity of the “Travel Tiger” imagery contained within the Collectible.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT8=Subjectivity of Collectibles. The value of each Collectible (if any) is inherently subjective, in the same way the value of other collectibles is inherently subjective. Each Collectible has no inherent or intrinsic value. Some collectors might prefer to have a Collectible featuring a certain characteristic, while others might prefer an equivalent Collectible featuring a different characteristic. We further do not make any representation or warranty in relation to the value of each Collectible in a secondary Marketplace.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT9=Restrictions on Purchases and Transfers: You may not purchase a Collectible if you are a Prohibited Person nor may you transfer a Collectible to any Prohibited Person. A \u201CProhibited Person\u201D means any such person, as determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion, that is: unable to pass any know-your-client requirements as may be determined by us from time to time in our sole and absolute discretion; a resident of or any person or entity that has any relevant connection to any jurisdiction in which entry into, or the performance of any of your obligations under these Terms, would be deemed illegal, unlawful or restricted in any way, or requires licensing, registration or approval of any kind; a member of the public in the Cayman Islands; a citizen or resident of or located in, or a legal entity formed or incorporated within or subject to the laws of, a Prohibited Jurisdiction (irrespective of whether use of a virtual private network or other technical workaround to effect such transaction and avoid detection within a Prohibited Jurisdiction); an individual or an individual employed by or associated with a legal entity or a legal entity identified on the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s denied persons or entity list, the United States Department of Treasury\u2019s specially designated nationals or blocked persons lists, the United States Department of State\u2019s debarred parties list, the consolidated sanctions list maintained by the United States Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control any United Nations Security Council sanctions lists or any other sanctions list;  identified as a terrorist organization on any other relevant lists maintained by any governmental authority;  acting, directly or indirectly, in contravention of any applicable law;  in any manner limited or prohibited (or that requires licensing, registration or approval of any kind) from the purchasing, possessing, transferring, using or otherwise conducting a transaction involving any amount of digital assets under applicable law; or has been involved at any time in any type of activity associated with money laundering or terrorist financing or any other applicable anti-corruption or anti bribery statute or has been subject to any investigation or sanction by, or a request for information from, any governmental authority relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption or bribery in any jurisdiction or under any applicable law; or a politically exposed person (\u201CPEP\u201D) as defined by the Financial Action Task Force (or such similar person under any applicable law) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function or an immediate family member or close associate of a PEP or any corporation, business or other entity that has been formed by, or for the benefit of, a PEP or any immediate family member or close associate of a PEP.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT10=Financial Transactions on Platform. Any payments or financial transactions that you engage in via the Platform will be conducted solely through the Network. We have no control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions. We have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you engage in via the Platform, or any other payment or transactions that you conduct via the Network. We do not provide refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the Platform, whether for Collectibles or anything else.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT11=Gas Fees. Every transaction on the Network requires the payment of a transaction fee (each, a \u201CGas Fee\u201D). The Gas Fees fund the network of computers that run the decentralized network upon which the Network operates. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that you instigate via the Platform. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, you will be solely responsible to pay any Gas Fee for any transaction that you instigate via the Platform.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT12=Responsibility for Taxes. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, the \u201CTaxes\u201D) associated with your use of the Platform. Except for income taxes levied on us, you: (a) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (b) will not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments (including Gas Fees) made to us pursuant to these Terms. 
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT13=Ownership of Collectible. Because each Collectible is an NFT on the Network, when you purchase a Collectible in accordance with these Terms (and not through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities), you own the underlying NFT completely. This means that you have the right to swap your Collectible, sell it, or give it away. Ownership of the Collectible is mediated entirely by the Network. Except as otherwise permitted by these Terms in cases where we determine that the Collectible has not been rightfully acquired from a legitimate source (including, without limitation, through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities), at no point will we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Collectible. 
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT14=We Own the Platform. You acknowledge and agree that we (or, as applicable, our licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to all other elements of the Platform, and all intellectual property rights therein (including, without limitation, all Art, designs, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, \u201Clook and feel\u201D, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the Platform (collectively, the \u201CPlatform Materials\u201D)). You acknowledge that the Platform Materials are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. All Platform Materials are the copyrighted property of us or our licensors, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names associated with the Platform or otherwise contained in the Platform Materials are proprietary to us or our licensors.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT15=No User License or Ownership of Platform Materials. Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the Platform does not grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other Platform Materials that you may access on or through the Platform. We reserve all rights in and to the Platform Materials that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT16=Further User Ownership Acknowledgements. For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (a) that your purchase of a Collectible, whether via the Platform or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the Platform Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the associated Art) other than those expressly contained in these Terms; (b) that you do not have the right, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of the Platform Materials (including, without limitation, any Art) without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion; and (c) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any of our trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT17=User License to Art. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased Collectibles, solely for the following purposes: (a) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (b) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Purchased Collectibles, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Collectible owner\u2019s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Collectible to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (c) as part of a third-party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Purchased Collectible, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Collectible\u2019s owner\u2019s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Collectible to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Collectible leaves the website/application. 
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT18=Restrictions on Ownership. You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without our (or, as applicable, our licensors\u2019) express prior written consent in each case: (a) modify the Art for your Purchased Collectible in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (b) use the Art for your Purchased Collectible to advertise, market, or sell any third-party product or service; (c) use the Art for your Purchased Collectible in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (d) use the Art for your Purchased Collectible in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (e) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased Collectible; (f) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased Collectible; or (g) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased Collectible for your or any third party\u2019s commercial benefit.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT19=Third Party IP. If the Art associated with your Purchased Collectible contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a third party), you understand and agree as follows: (a) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (b) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, we may need to (and reserve every right to) pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (c) to the extent that we inform you of such additional restrictions in writing, you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of the license contained in this Section 4.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT20=Other Terms of License. The license granted in Section 4(v) above applies only to the extent that you continue to Own the applicable Purchased Collectible. If at any time you sell, swap, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased Collectible for any reason, the license granted in Section 4(v) will immediately expire with respect to that Collectible without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for that Collectible. The restrictions in Sections 4(vii) and 4(viii) will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT21=All secondary marketplace transactions are subject to the following provisions: the Collectible transferee (the \u201CTransferee\u201D) shall, by receiving an ownership interest in the Collectible, be deemed to accept all of the provisions of these Terms;  the Collectible transferor (the \u201CTransferor\u201D) shall provide notice to the Transferee of these Terms including a link or other method by which these Terms may be accessible by the Transferee; the Transferor shall pay us such percentage of the gross amounts paid by the Transferee as we may reasonably determine as a Platform user fee (the \u201CUser Fee\u201D) regardless of the venue of the sale of the Collectible; the User Fee shall be paid on the same terms and at the same time as the Transferor is paid by the Transferee;  both the Transferor and the Transferee acknowledge and agree that the amounts payable hereunder as the User Fee do not include, and are not intended to cover, any additional fees imposed or required by the transferring platform or Marketplace through which You transfer the Collectible to the Transferee; and without limitation of any other termination rights, we may suspend or terminate the license granted in Section 4(v) if we have a reasonable basis for believing that You have engaged in an off-chain sale of a Collectible, or otherwise engaged in any off-chain transactions for the purchase or sale of a Collectible without paying the applicable User Fee. You, and all subsequent Transferees, shall be responsible for paying the User Fees associated with the secondary transaction purchase price, regardless of whether such purchase price is fulfilled on-chain, off-chain, or in a combination of the foregoing.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT22=User Feedback. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the Platform, including without limitation about how to improve the Platform (collectively, \u201CFeedback\u201D). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT23=User Warranties. Without limiting the foregoing, you warrant and agree that your use of the Platform will not (and will not allow any third party to): in any manner: involve the sending, uploading, distributing or disseminating any unlawful, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content; involve the distribution of any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or any other items of a destructive or deceptive nature; involve the uploading, posting, transmitting or otherwise making available through the Platform any content that infringes the intellectual proprietary rights of any party; involve using the Platform to violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others;  involve engaging in, promoting, or encouraging illegal activity (including, without limitation, money laundering); involve interfering with other users\u2019 enjoyment of the Platform; involve exploiting the Platform for any unauthorized commercial purpose; involve modifying, adapting, translating, or reverse engineering any portion of the Platform; involve removing any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the Platform or any part of it; involve reformatting or framing any portion of the Platform; involve displaying any content on the Platform that contains any hate-related or violent content or contains any other material, products or services that violate or encourage conduct that would violate any criminal laws, any other applicable laws, or any third party rights; involve using any spider, site search/retrieval application, or other device to retrieve or index any portion of the Platform or the content posted on the Platform, or to collect information about its users for any unauthorized purpose; involve accessing or using the Platform for the purpose of creating a product or service that is competitive with any of our products or services; involve abusing, harassing, or threatening another user of the Platform or any of our authorized representatives, customer service personnel, chat board moderators, or volunteers (including, without limitation, filing support tickets with false information, sending excessive emails or support tickets, obstructing our employees from doing their jobs, refusing to follow the instructions of our employees, or publicly disparaging us by implying favoritism by any of our employees or otherwise); or involve using any abusive, defamatory, ethnically or racially offensive, harassing, harmful, hateful, obscene, offensive, sexually explicit, threatening or vulgar language when communicating with another user of the Platform or any of our authorized representatives, customer service personnel, chat board moderators, or volunteers (each, a \u201CCategory A Prohibited Activity\u201D); and/or in any manner: involve creating user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent pretenses; involve the impersonation of another person (via the use of an email address or otherwise); involve using, employing, operating, or creating a computer program to simulate the human behavior of a user (\u201CBots\u201D); involve using, employing, or operating Bots or other similar forms of automation to engage in any activity or transaction on the Platform (including, without limitation, purchases of Collectibles on the Marketplace); involve acquiring Collectibles through inappropriate or illegal means (including, among other things, using a stolen credit card, or a payment mechanism that you do not have the right to use, or purchasing a Collectible and then attempting to charge the cost back to your payment method while still maintaining ownership or control of the Collectible or selling, gifting or trading the Collectible to someone else); or involve the purchasing, selling or facilitating the purchase and sale of any user\u2019s account(s) to other users or third parties for cash or cryptocurrency consideration outside of the Platform; or otherwise involve or result in the wrongful seizure or receipt of any Collectibles or other digital assets (each, a \u201CCategory B Prohibited Activity\u201D and, together with Category A Prohibited Activity, the \u201CProhibited Activities\u201D).
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT24=Effect of Your Breaches. If you engage in any of the Prohibited Activities, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, without notice or liability to you, and without limiting any of our other rights or remedies at law or in equity, immediately suspend or terminate your user account and/or delete your Collectibles\u2019 images and descriptions from the Platform. If we delete your Collectibles\u2019 images and descriptions from the Platform, such deletion will not affect your ownership rights in any NFTs that you already Own, but you will not receive a refund of any amounts you paid for those Collectibles. 
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT25=You Terminate. You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the Platform and discontinuing your access to and use of the Platform. If you cancel your account, or otherwise terminate these Terms, you will not receive any refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the Platform, whether for Collectibles or anything else.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT26=We Terminate. You agree that we, in our sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate these Terms and suspend and/or terminate your account(s) for the Platform without the provision of prior notice. You agree that any suspension or termination of your access to the Platform may be without prior notice, and that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such suspension or termination.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT27=Other Remedies Available. If we terminate these Terms or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the Platform due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity (including, without limitation, if you engage in any of the Prohibited Activities), then termination of these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT28=Referral to Governmental Authority. We have the right, without provision of prior notice, to take appropriate legal action, including, without limitation, referral to law enforcement or regulatory authority, or notifying the harmed party of any illegal or unauthorized use of the Platform. Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone using the Platform.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT29=Effect of Termination. Upon any termination or expiration of these Terms, whether by you or us, you may no longer have access to information that you have posted on the Platform or that is related to your account, and you acknowledge that we will have no obligation to maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such information to you or to any third party. Sections 1 and 3 through 17 will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for any reason.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT30=Value and Volatility. The prices of collectible blockchain assets are extremely volatile and subjective and collectible blockchain assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Collectibles, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. Each Collectible has no inherent or intrinsic value. We cannot guarantee that any Collectibles purchased will retain their original value, as the value of collectibles is inherently subjective and factors occurring outside of the Platform\u2019s ecosystem may materially impact the value and desirability of any particular Collectible.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT31=Tax Calculations. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Collectible-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the Platform.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT32=Use of Blockchain. The Platform does not store, send, or receive Collectibles. This is because Collectibles exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Platform\u2019s supporting blockchain in the Network. Any transfer of Collectibles occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Network, and not on the Platform.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT33=Inherent Risks with Internet Currency. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Network, however caused.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT34=Regulatory and Legal Uncertainty. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially and/or adversely affect the development of the Platform\u2019s ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your Collectibles. Any Transferee of a Collectible may need to take additional steps to perfect the license granted in Section 4(v) to the original Transferor. The requirements under applicable law may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We may be willing to assist with such perfection of the license so long as we do not incur any costs and the effort required is not onerous in any way. 
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT35=Software Risks. Upgrades to the Network, a hard fork in the Network, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Network may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the Network\u2019s NFT standard, including the Platform\u2019s ecosystem. 
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT36=Force Majeure Events. We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of these Terms, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from the following force majeure events (\u201CForce Majeure Event(s)\u201D): (a) acts of God; (b) flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics, including the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), tsunami, explosion; (c) war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest; (d) government order, law, or action; (e) embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date hereof; (f) strikes, labour stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances; (g) shortage of adequate or suitable Internet connectivity, telecommunication breakdown or shortage of adequate power or electricity; and (h) other similar events beyond our control.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT37=Performance During Force Majeure Events. If we suffer a Force Majeure Event, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you of the Force Majeure Event, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. We will use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Events are minimized. We will resume the performance of our obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the removal of the cause. In the event that our failure or delay remains uncured for a period of forty-five (45) consecutive days following written notice given by us under this Section 12, we may thereafter terminate these Terms upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT38=Entire Agreement. These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire legal agreement between you and us and will be deemed to be the final and integrated agreement between you and us, and govern your access to and use of the Platform, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and us related to your access to or use of the Platform, whether oral or written.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT39=Third-Party Beneficiaries. For the purposes of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Revised) of the Cayman Islands, each indemnified person not a party to these Terms is an intended third-party beneficiary under these Terms. However, the parties to these Terms may rescind or vary these Terms (including any variation so as to extinguish or alter a third party's entitlement to enforce any provisions of these Terms) without the consent of any such third party.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT40=Interpretation. The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT41=Severability. Should any part of these Terms be held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, that portion will be deemed severed from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.
NFT_TERM_SUB_CONTENT42=No Waivers. Our failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute or be deemed a waiver of future exercise or enforcement of such right or provision.

FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT3=In order to bring You the best possible service, We offer You an exclusive and unique extended guarantee for the usability of the flight itinerary brokered by Us within Our Services in case Your booking is affected by a Flight Disruption in the form of Our exclusive and unique assistant services (in accordance with these Terms), hereinafter referred to as the \u201CTravelSmart Protection\u201D. The TravelSmart Protection is provided as part of Our Services and these Terms are supplemental to the Travala.com Terms and Conditions which continue to apply for any Booking.
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT4=Please note that Our offer of the TravelSmart Protection is conditioned by Your contractual opt-in for provision of TravelSmart Protection in case of a Flight Disruption is related to any of Your Bookings made with Us and is accepted by Us. You may contractually opt-in for the provision of the TravelSmart Protection based on the specific general contractual stipulation between Us and You, or within the specific booking process, via technical means availed to You for this purpose (e.g. the Website) in compliance with the respective technical documentation and associated terms. In the event that such general contractual stipulation includes any limitations or different terms and conditions compared to these Terms, this Terms prevails and governs the provision of the TravelSmart Protection to You.
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT5=Please note, that even in case You will not contractually opt-in for the TravelSmart Protection, if necessary, We are prepared to provide You with free assistance in the situation of a Flight Disruption affecting Your Flight itinerary, provided that the Flight Disruption was not announced to You by the respective Selected Carrier or Us more than one (1) hour prior to the departure of the first concerned Flight affected by the Flight Disruption, when the rule Art. 2.1 b) Point (1) hereof (alternative transportation offer) will be applied analogically (hereinafter the \u201CTransfer Protection\u201D).

FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT10=Where You learn about a Flight Disruption under Scenario A, You must inform Us of such a Flight Disruption without undue delay by contacting us here or at support@travala.com or via live chat on Travala.com. Should You fail to inform Us about such Flight Disruption(s) without undue delay, You will not be entitled to the TravelSmart Protection. Where We are informed first about the Flight Disruption according to Scenario A, We will contact You within a reasonable time after We learn about such Flight Disruption(s).
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT11=After We have been informed about the Flight Disruption(s) according to Scenario A, We will offer You the following solutions (subject to availability), from which you may select one solely at Your discretion:
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT12=You are obliged to reply to Us promptly after receiving Our information about the offered solution(s), but in all cases at the latest within any reasonable time before the time of the scheduled departure of the first Flight of Your itinerary. Please note that Our offer may be changed due to availability of the offered solutions. Notwithstanding, in the event the aforesaid offer is not accepted by You within twenty four (24) hours before the scheduled departure time of the first Flight of Your itinerary, the offer shall be null and void and therefore You will not be entitled to the TravelSmart Protection in this matter.
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT13=The TravelSmart Protection stipulated in this Article 2.1(b) applies only to a Flight Disruption announced less than/equal to 48 hours prior to the departure and/or after departure of the first concerned Flight affected by the Flight Disruption (hereinafter referred to as \u201CScenario B\u201D).
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT14=In this case, if You learn about a Flight Disruption under Scenario B, You must inform Us of such a Flight Disruption without undue delay by contacting us here or at support@travala.com or via live chat on Travala.com. Should You fail to inform Us about such a Flight Disruption without undue delay, You will not be entitled to the TravelSmart Protection.

FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT16=After We have been informed about the Flight Disruption under Scenario B, You may choose one of the following solutions (as available) at Your discretion:

FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT20=Our offer of the TravelSmart Protection described in Article 2 hereof will automatically expire and You shall have no claim whatsoever to the performance by Us of any of the TravelSmart Protection services. This provision does not preclude You from buying (an) alternate Flight(s) in accordance with Terms herein \u2013 if You do so in compliance with these Terms, the TravelSmart Protection will remain valid and claimable. On the contrary, should You amend or alter the schedule of the original Flight(s) ordered in the Booking without first confirming with Our customer service department and seeking their approval, the TravelSmart Protection will become invalid and We will be absolved of all liability and responsibilities in case of any issue that may occur during Your journey.
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT21=3. Limitation of the TravelSmart Protection \u2013 Force Majeure. Please be informed that the TravelSmart Protection does not apply to cases of Flight Disruptions caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. Such circumstances may, in particular, occur in cases of political instability, meteorological conditions, governmental restrictions and recommendations due to any reason which makes it incompatible with the operation of the flight concerned, security and health risks, unexpected transport safety shortcomings and strikes that affect the operation of an operating air carrier, significant limitation of airport(s) and/or train and/or bus station operation, as well as bankruptcy, insolvency or termination of 50% or more of all flights of the Selected Carrier or any other effect which significantly limits or disables the Selected Carrier or operating Carrier to provide its services (hereinafter referred as \u201CForce Majeure\u201D). Please note that in these cases We will make Our best effort to offer an alternative Flight(s) and or other alternative transportation in order to eliminate inconveniences that You may incur in relation to this matter. However, We have no obligation to provide You with the TravelSmart Protection or otherwise cover the expenses for the alternative Flight(s) and/or other means of transportation for the Flight(s) affected by the effects of Force Majeure as well as other connecting Flight(s) which were not used due to the effect of Force Majeure.
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT22=4. Refunds. If, under these Terms, You are entitled to receive a refund as a result of exercising the TravelSmart Protection, it will be refunded in accordance with the Travala.com Terms and Conditions. If You exercised the TravelSmart Protection under Article 2.1(a) (Scenario A) herein and purchased the Booking using cryptocurrency or fiat currency, You may opt for a full refund in Travel Credits, which You can immediately use for a new booking with Us. If You paid in fiat currency, You may instead opt to receive an assisted refund with the carriers, in which case we will cancel the whole trip and request a monetary refund from the carriers for you. The refund will depend on the carrier's terms and policy, and some carriers might not provide any refund or only offer credit or vouchers. If You exercised the TravelSmart Protection under Article 2.1(b) (Scenario B) herein and purchased the Booking using cryptocurrency or fiat currency, You may opt for a full refund in Travel Credits for the unused parts of your itinerary, which You can immediately use for a new booking with Us. If You paid in fiat currency, You may instead opt to receive a full monetary refund for the unused parts of your itinerary, in which case we will send the refund back to you via the same payment method you used to book your trip. The time period in which it would take to complete the refund would depend on the financial institutions involved.
FLIGHT_PAID_CONTENT23=The TravelSmart Protection stipulated in this Article 2.1(a) applies only to a Flight Disruption announced more than 48 hours prior to the departure of the first concerned Flight affected by the Flight Disruption (hereinafter referred to as \u201CScenario A\u201D).
FLIGHT_PAID_SUB_CONTENT1=We will search for alternate transportation to Your Destination. Should We find an alternate option not exceeding the price You paid for all the unused Flight(s), We may offer You (an) alternate Flight(s) or other means of transportation to Your Destination at no additional cost to You. We may also offer You an alternate option that exceeds the price You paid for all the unused Flight(s). If selected, any difference between the price of the offered alternate and the price of the unused Flights must be paid by You. In case We are unable to provide You with the offered alternate Flight(s) or other means of transportation for You online, upon Our confirmation, You may purchase ticket(s) for alternate transportation to Your original final destination, as agreed upon by Us and You, at the airport or other place of transition and, at Our discretion, We may refund You the pre-agreed price of such ticket(s) up to the price You paid for all the unused Flight(s) under the conditions given in Article 3 hereof. Please note that You must contact Us and obtain Our approval before purchasing ticket(s) for the alternate transportation on Your own, otherwise You will not be entitled to the refund of its price hereunder.

This option will be determined and agreed on a case-by-case basis. Please note that You must contact Us and obtain Our approval before purchasing ticket(s) for the alternate transportation on Your own, otherwise You will not be entitled to the refund of its price hereunder.

The Smart Program is a combination of free and paid memberships. With tiers Basic to Platinum, you retain ownership of the AVA Tokens used to activate your access to the Smart Program.

To assist you in any reporting obligations that you may have, we provide you with your transaction history in your Account, including all deposits, withdrawals, and the history of any Benefits distributed to you as a result of your participation in the Smart Program. Please be aware that we are not obligated to, and will not determine, whether any taxes apply to you, nor will we collect, calculate, report, or remit any taxes to any tax authority on your behalf.

SMART_TERM_CONTENT44=4.10 By participating in the Smart Program, you agree to a minimum of 30 days before you can deactivate. Once deactivated, you must wait a further 30 days before you can reactivate the Smart Program for your Account.

A Forked Network may affect the value of a Digital Asset stored in your Wallet. We reserve the right to suspend any part of the Services in order to determine, at our sole discretion, whether or not to support the Forked Network. Where we decide not to support a Forked Network, we reserve the right to the sole ownership of any Digital Assets derived from the Forked Network.

INSPIRATION_POST1_TITLE23=The Final Night
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT1=It was a familiar start to our anything but unfamiliar trip: an MRA swap gliding 2 centimetres up our nostrils. We had just gotten off the plane at Kilimanjaro International and, admittedly, we were a little cranky. Me because an eight hour flight isn\u2019t exactly my idea of a good time (even if it was in business class), my girlfriend because she had to put up with me.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT2=Although we had a surprisingly tasty lunch on the plane, we elected not to have dinner so we could properly enjoy the Lodge\u2019s cuisine. In hindsight, this was a mistake. The plane wasn\u2019t set to land until close to 9pm, and the Lodge was more than an hour away by car. And come to think of it, her New Year\u2019s Resolution to stop drinking probably didn\u2019t help, either. At least I had a nice buzz going from the complimentary sparkling.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT3=We got through customs without any major hiccups and were instructed on where to meet our chauffeur. In our tired and hungry state, we meandered our way over to the collections area. In the distance, we spotted him. Suit on, sign in hand. With perhaps the politest and most respectful of greetings I\u2019ve heard in a long time, he introduced himself before offering to grab our bags. We said we had too many for him to carry (no prizes for guessing which of us overpacked), and he promptly proved us wrong. It was time to begin our trip in earnest. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT4=Our home for the next two days was the aptly named Legendary Lodge, located at the foothills of Mount Meru on the outskirts of Arusha. The lodge was highly exclusive, with only twelve cottages over 1000 acres. I remember the lodge being quite breathtaking when we were first driving in, but if I\u2019m being honest, my mind was pretty squarely on one thing: food. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT5=We told the front desk staff our story and asked if the kitchen was closed. To our delight, she said they can always prepare us something, but we were perfectly on time for their sit-down dinner \u2014 it just couldn\u2019t be in the restaurant. Fine by us! The staff kindly took our bags and set up the formal dining room in our cottage. Dinner was an a la carte menu with three choices, which we really struggled to choose between. In the end, we started with prawn tempura followed by wonderful duck breast with a red wine jus, ending with a decadent chocolate souffl\u00E9. Only then did we raid the minibar. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT6=After finally waking up from our food and flight-induced coma, we had a tour of our cottage in the daylight. It was decorated with a unique blend of African and colonial-style decor, but with all the modern luxuries we\u2019re accustomed to. We had a king-sized bed, an en-suite bathroom with a rain shower and deep, free-standing tub, a separate lounge with a fireplace, and a wraparound veranda with views over Mount Meru.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT7=The staff came in to bring us a fruit basket to snack on throughout the day before taking our breakfast order. They offered to prepare the formal dining room for us again, but we wanted to take every opportunity we could to dine al fresco while overlooking the colourful grounds filled with the purple of the jacarandas, the flaming red of the African tulip trees and the soft white of the frangipanis. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT8=After a wholesome buffet of fresh fruits, pastries, cheese, meats, and a cooked breakfast, we decided to explore a little by savouring a sensory coffee tour on the neighbouring plantation.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT9=On our drive back to the lodge, the tour guide asked if we had any more plans on the agenda. Knowing we had a full week ahead of us, we said we were planning to just take it easy back at the resort. He suggested croquet on the lawns so we could relax while still experiencing everything they had on offer. Feeling particularly French, we surrendered \u2014 even deciding to get dressed up in our finest vacation attire to hit the ol\u2019 mallet around. I\u2019d prefer not to say what happens next, but suffice to say I lost. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT10=Exhausted from our tour and in a not overly adventurous mood, we spent our final day at the lodge by the pool escaping the January heat and admiring the retreat\u2019s natural surroundings. Steadfast in her resolution, my girlfriend sipped on mocktails, allowing me to enjoy a bottle of white to myself. After a few hours working on our collective tan in the sun, we decided it was best not to laze by the pool all day, so we did what anyone would do \u2014 go to the lodge\u2019s spa to be pampered in the air conditioning instead. We spent arguably a little too long here, for when we left the retreat\u2019s therapy room, the sun was already beginning to set. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT11=Under the last rays of the golden afternoon sun, we headed over to the sundowners garden, soaking up the African serenity while nibbling on a variety of cheeses and charcuteries to celebrate our final night at the very legendary lodge. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT12=A new day, a new adventure. We had one final breakfast at the lodge before our driver and tour guide, Joseph, came to pick us up in our private 4\u00D74. We travelled by road to the Ngorongoro Conservation area, where the Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is located \u2014 and that\u2019s a crater as in volcano crater. Ngorongoro is home to the world\u2019s largest inactive, intact and unfilled volcanic caldera, and our lodge was right on the edge of this World Heritage Site.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT13=The lodge resembled a baroque ch\u00E2teaux, with an eclectic blend of teak panelling, Victorian furnishings and whimsical African touches. Our suite was Maasai manyatta style with a banana leaf ceiling and grass roof, which provided authentic African ambiance. The interiors were once again colonial style and a mix of silver, gold and ruby colours with silk curtains hanging from the ceiling and tall, leather-backed chairs in front of the fireplace. My personal style errs on the side of minimalism, so I found the room nice, but just a touch busy for my liking. My girlfriend looked at me like I was an idiot and said it was, at worst, a welcome change from our hyper-modern monochromatic apartment and at best, \u201Cdrop-dead gorgeous\u201D. Different strokes. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT14=What we could both agree on was that the view was truly, undeniably, breathtakingly spectacular. Our central living area and deck had uninterrupted 180-degree views of the crater, so we were gifted with the sight of lush grasslands for as far as the eye could see, only interrupted by the opposing crater wall on the horizon. On some mornings, the crater would be cloaked in mist that would swirl with the wind and we just watched it dance. No food. No music. Just the calming mist captivating us with its movement. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT15=The ancient caldera shelters one of the most immensely concentrated wildlife havens on earth. 25,000 mammals live in the crater, including endangered black rhinos, elephants, lions, hyena, hippos, buffalos, wildebeest, gazelles, waterbucks, and several species of wild cats. There was no way in hell we were going to miss it. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT16=We descended into the Ngorongoro Crater through the lush highland forest, all the while entertaining our driver with our juvenile version of bird-watching. Juvenile because neither she nor I could name a single bird by name. \u201CI see a blue one\u201D, I said, or, \u201CLook, that one\u2019s short and fat!\u201D she exclaimed, giggling. He had a good laugh and asked us if we wanted to know what they were really called. We were happy in our ignorance. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT17=It was only shortly after we hit the grassy crater floor that we saw our first big game of the day: a herd of grazing gazelles. Our guide told us that gazelles are, for lack of a better term, nervous wrecks, so we tried to keep our distance. It seemed to do the trick, mainly due to the fact that they didn\u2019t run for dear life. So we continued to watch for a while longer, but eventually left to continue on with the drive.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT18=Going east towards the Gorigor Swamp and Ngoitokitok Springs, we saw a pod of hippos basking on the shoreline and bobbing in the water. We had heard the hippos were actually quite dangerous, so we expected to see some sort of fighting between them, if not rampaging towards us. Alas, they were resigned to lying in the mud all day.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT19=Unfortunately for us, we had missed the dry season by quite a few months, so we didn\u2019t get the chance to see any flamingos. A little underwhelmed, I half-jokingly said to our guide: \u201CWhere are all the animals?\u201D. After all, this is one of the most densely packed areas of wildlife in Africa, I had expected a little more. Our guide assured us not to worry and that the bulk of the resident game resides up north in the drier, open grasslands, but that if we were getting tired, we could turn back now for lunch. Trusting him, we went ahead. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT20=He was right. We cleared the forest and opened on a clearing of dry, short grass. Zebras were next to wildebeest, were next to elephants, were next to lions. As far as the eye could see, different animals were scattered across the plains, intermingling in small groups with little regard to species. I was shocked and, honestly, a bit confused. Were the zebras not afraid of the lions? How can they stand so close to one another? We started flooding our guide with questions. As it turns out, lions only hunt every 2-3 days, and only 30% of these hunts are successful (King of the Jungle my ass), so when the lions are full, they don\u2019t pose much of a threat.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT21=Following the dirt road, we slowly made our way across the track, admiring the animals as we passed. We saw mothers licking their young, wildebeest brawls, and I wanna say at least one lion marital dispute. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT22=After putting enough distance between us and the carnivores, we reached the designated picnic lunch spot. The staff had set the tables with snowy tablecloths and sparkling silver cutlery, and an army of butlers sprang into action to lay the table with today\u2019s delectable dishes, served against a backdrop of zebras strolling along the crater floor.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT23=Serengeti, here we come. Via private charter, no less. Now, in general, I\u2019m not much of a plane guy. I don\u2019t get claustrophobic, but I don\u2019t particularly like tight spaces. Well, as it turns out, I\u2019m a private plane guy. We only had a short flight, but the Pilatus PC-12 might\u2019ve actually been bigger than my first apartment. We got to our destination in less than 30 minutes, and with only three people on board, legroom became a thing of the past \u2014 stretch out, get up and walk around, do some squats, the floor\u2019s yours. It was a dream. We were on route to the Namiri Plains Camp, the third stop in our journey, but the first not to have any fixed walls. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT24=The Namiri Plains are located on the eastern side of the Serengeti National Park in big cat territory. Cheetahs roam the area in pursuit of prey, leopards hunt undisturbed, and one very peculiar melanistic serval named Manja has been known to make an appearance from time to time, albeit rarely. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT25=The camp itself is quite small and exclusive, comprising just ten tented suites with sweeping 360-degree views of the plains. Ours came equipped with a king-sized bed, an ensuite bathroom with indoor and outdoor showers, and a resin bath on the deck. Hardly slumming it, but there was definitely an increased sense of being one with nature through the tent\u2019s unusual architecture, which gave us privacy while maximising our openness to the outdoors.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT26=Still swooning from our crater game drive, we decided to spend our first day at camp relaxing and just taking a breather. We spent most of the day decompressing in our tent, reading and talking with only the plains as witness. We ate a light picnic lunch in the shade of the nearby acacia trees before retiring for a midday siesta. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT27=When we awoke, our guide informed us it was BBQ night and to come hungry. We all met in the dining tent for a buffet of meats, salads, and traditional Swahili dishes with beers all round. Well, sans one. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT28=Sharing a meal really helped foster a sense of community and camaraderie between the guests and the staff. We told them about our lives back home, they told us about their culture and heritage. It felt like a genuine exchange.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT29=On our second day, we wanted to get to know the land better. We opted to explore the Serengeti on foot through a guided walking tour. By stepping out of the vehicle, it felt like we could see better. Not only was nature less startled by the noise of the engine, but we got to appreciate it more as an equal. We were able to identify butterflies, ants, termites and various beetles on our track. It was a great opportunity to learn about how the whole Serengeti ecosystem works. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT30=Having now done a game drive and walking tour, there was one more experience we wanted to tick off while in Tanzania: the hot-air balloon. One thing we noticed while on our walking tour is how much less intrusive we were. The animals \u2014 thankfully \u2014 just aren\u2019t that accustomed to the sound of a moving vehicle. Going by hot-air balloon offered not only a less intrusive look into their lives but from a different perspective, too. We told the staff of our desires and they set it up for the next morning.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT31=Excited for what was to come, we woke up bright and early. Well, dark and early. Takeoff wasn\u2019t until 6am, and the balloon needed to be prepped first. Nevertheless, it was truly an iconic way to experience the wilderness of East Africa. We flew silently over the plains as they teemed with herds of wildlife, the sun beginning to glisten over the horizon. We got to witness the world wake up. Herds began to roam, the nocturnals returned to slumber. It was an experience I\u2019ve never had before. And as we were starting to descend, we could see the staff setting up a romantic breakfast for two on the plains. A fitting end to a memorable flight. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT32=It was back to the airport for the final leg of our journey. Destination: Zanzibar. Home to the Baraza Resort & Spa, an oceanfront, 5-star resort that features classic Swahili architecture, including dramatic arches, cement benches, and intricate, hand-carved cement decorations. Our villa was filled with handmade furniture, brass lanterns, and luxurious white-and-golden fabrics. Not only did we have a private plunge pool, there was also a spacious terrace with ocean views.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT33=The resort had three restaurants, and I\u2019m not joking when I say this, one for each meal of the day. They all had a different theme and cuisine, but in general, were inspired by a fusion of culinary cultures across Africa, Asia, India, and Persia. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT34=On our first night, Baraza\u2019s evening restaurant \u2014 the Sultans Dining Room \u2014 was table d\u2019hote: a fixed menu of the chef\u2019s creations. The limited choice might not have been everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but as foodies, we loved it. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT35=We were served a five-course dinner, starting with gratinated crab claws with tomato relish and sauteed spinach as our first bite. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT36=Crab was followed by vanilla king prawns with avocado napoleon, bloody mary dressing, and mizuna leaves. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT37=Next came creamy mussel soup with crispy mussel tempura. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT38=For the main course, we were given two options to choose from. The first was a seafood platter of lobster, jumbo prawns, and a fillet of red snapper with reef sea urchin sauce, a spinach parcel and cherry tomato confit. The second was the fillet of beef tenderloin with truffle scented potato souffle, confit shallots bonbon, porcini puree and rosemary sauce. We chose both. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT39=Finally, for dessert, we were served a simple but delectable chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream and edible flowers.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT40=Having gorged ourselves the night before, we agreed it was probably best to get our bodies moving. We asked the concierge what they recommended for fitness and they gave us a couple of ideas that ranged from gentle palm weaving on the beach to intensive multi-day kitesurfing lessons. Given more time, we might\u2019ve done both, but our trip was coming to an end and the Indian Ocean was calling to us. We asked what they had available for beginners. Not ten minutes later, we were scheduled for a guided snorkelling tour.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT41=We met our guide on dry land and they ran us through the safety instructions and a couple of hand gestures so we could communicate underwater. Then they gave us our equipment: goggles, flippers, and of course, snorkels.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT42=We started the tour from the beach, swimming out just a few metres into the crystal clear water when we came across a series of brightly coloured and noticeably spikey starfish on the seafloor. The guide assured us they weren\u2019t dangerous, but that we shouldn\u2019t touch them as they\u2019re an important part of the ecosystem. It was a pleasant surprise stumbling across such an interesting-looking creature so early in the tour.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT43=As we swam on, our guide pointed out fish after fish, telling us their species name and rarity. Over the course of our trip, we easily saw more than 100 types of beautiful, colourful, exotic fish, of which I can remember the names of precisely two: Dory and Nemo.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT44=Towards the end of the dive, we came across another star of the 2003 smash hit. Turns out Zanzibar is a nesting ground for green sea turtles, and they\u2019re a surprisingly common find! We were delighted. Crush was either extremely curious or just highly accustomed to humans, because he swam up to us. We got the guide to take our photo, which is probably my favourite memento of the whole trip.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT45=Back on land, we washed off the day\u2019s activities and prepared for pre-dinner mocktails at the Dhahabu Bar & Lounge. An open-air lounge lit exclusively by candlelight, we spent the evening discussing what we were appreciative of as we watched the sun set over the ocean.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT46=When we returned to the villa, the staff had laid out candles and a personal buffet, complete with two glasses of champagne and a folded note from my girlfriend that read: \u201CTo end such a magnificent trip with anything but champagne would be no end at all\u201D. I knew her resolution wouldn\u2019t last. 
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT47=As the night went on and the conversation flowed, we decided to trade dinner at the Sultans for a final moonlit walk on the beach.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT48=We were arriving close to 10:30pm at night, so I figured there were pretty good odds we\u2019d be stuck raiding the minibar. Not even close.
INSPIRATION_POST1_CONTENT49=We followed how the beans go from tree to cup, touching and smelling them at every step in the journey. It was very educational, but far more importantly, the coffee we had at the end of the tour was awe-inspiring. Full-bodied, intense, creamy, and with notes of sweet berries. I\u2019ve fully accepted that I\u2019m going to sound like a total prick anytime I describe this cup of ambrosia to my friends back home. Worth it.

INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT1=Stepping out of the air-conditioned terminal of Colombo Airport and out into the welcoming mid-autumn air of Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial capital city, I felt unequivocally weightless. I\u2019d chosen Sri Lanka for a reprieve from the ensuing European cold and its proximity to the Maldives (for which I was later bound), but also for the country\u2019s strong cultural and traditional roots \u2014 values I wanted to escape to in a world galloping ever forward towards an increasingly technological future.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT2=As I entered the transfer vehicle, the sharp-dressed driver holding the car door ajar for me \u2014 who had greeted me inside at the baggage claim \u2014 asked if I\u2019d ever visited Sri Lanka before. I said I had, but only for a couple of nights several years ago on a business trip, and that this time I was venturing much further than the city.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT3=\u201CAh,\u201D he said, catching my eye in the rear-view mirror as we pulled away from the curb, \u201Cthen you\u2019re in for a treat.\u201D And he was absolutely right.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT4=After about an hour of taking in the beautiful Sri Lankan views from the backseat, we arrived at The Residence by Uga Escapes, where I\u2019d be spending the night before making the short trip to Sigiriya in the morning. The hotel was uniquely grand: a Victorian townhouse built in the nineteenth century by a wealthy barrister, complete with a fine dining restaurant, bar and views onto shimmering skyscrapers from the in-ground swimming pool.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT5=With not much point in unpacking I headed to the restaurant, and after some delicious gourmet lobster ravioli and white wine, I called it a night.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT6=After breakfast at the hotel, it was back to Colombo Airport for a private flight to Sigiriya, an ancient, UNESCO-listed heritage site in the heart of the country. I\u2019d be spending three nights at the Water Garden Sigiriya, which has a prime view of the chief attraction: an ancient rock fortress once used as a royal palace.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT7=The half-hour flight was over in a flash, and as the verdant countryside became a blur of green and brown beyond the window of the transfer car, I felt my body heave a relaxed sigh, exhaling any remaining stresses of the outside world.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT8=The resort certainly lived up to its name: expansive, winding tributaries and lush greenery bordered the villas, with lanterns illuminating the way around secret gardens tucked away around the complex. It was just after lunchtime when I arrived, and with temperatures climbing, I opted for a dip in the private plunge pool to cool off and take in the tranquility of the unbridled, 360-degree beauty.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT9=With dinner and breakfast included in my stay, the natural next stop was to sample the cuisine. The dishes, all made using local organic local ingredients, were impeccably presented. Following the feast, I capped off the night with a tropical cocktail at the resort\u2019s Twin Level Bar, dozing off to the panoramic views of the rolling countryside.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT10=After a breakfast of muesli and yoghurt topped with fresh tropical fruit, I headed off an hour east to the city of Polonnaruwa for a tour of its historic ruins. Constructed in the 12th century, my guide took me through beautifully intricate architecture within the group of ruins known as the \u201CQuadrangle\u201D, explaining the religious significance of the scattered shrines, statues and dome-shaped stupas (burial structures used in Buddhism). 
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT11=Of particular note was the Vatadage, a circular structure within the Quadrangle believed to have been built to house the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. With the number of wild macaques running about the place, it\u2019s no surprise that the sacred tooth was no longer there.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT12=As the sun passed its peak in the cloudless sky above, we pushed on towards Minneriya National Park, the country\u2019s premier safari boasting the largest elephant gathering in the world \u2014 over 300 at a time! Besides the big trunked creatures, we were treated to sights of deer, buffalo, mongoose and even the adorable sloth bears, all from the comfort of the jeep.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT13=With the rain starting to drizzle on the car\u2019s canopy right at the conclusion of the tour, a packed day of sightseeing was wrapped up. Back at the hotel, I scarcely made it through another divine dinner before my eyes decided to draw the shades almost of their own accord.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT14=As much as I would\u2019ve loved to have stayed in bed till noon, I elected to take the opportunity to climb the Sigiriya Rock Fortress, the giant formation which, for the last couple of nights, had watched over me from beyond my window.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT15=Built in the 5th century, the fortress originally resembled a gigantic lion. In truth, not much of the leonine facade remains \u2014 just the front paws at the base of the fortress, where we began our ascent. The site exhibited well-preserved frescoes of Sinhalese maidens, a rock palace at the summit and the famous mirror wall, a 100-metre stone wall said to have once been so highly polished that you could see your reflection as you walked by.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT16=The gardens of the fortress are among the oldest in the world, with terraces and limestone staircases flanking the path leading to the lion-pawed entrance. To further protect the illegitimate King Kashyapa from invasion at the time of the site\u2019s construction, a moat was built that encircles the fortress which. For the record, it didn\u2019t work. The king\u2019s brother, who was the rightful heir, eventually retook the throne some 18 years later by overthrowing the fortress.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT17=With around 750 steps leading to the 660-foot summit, the entire ascent and descent took a little over 3 hours at a comfortable pace, with time to soak in the incredible views from the top. After all that walking, it was time to head back, cool off and enjoy my last night in the villa with a local dish and a few well-earned drinks.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT18=A hearty bacon and egg breakfast with a side of fresh juice brought a close to my time at Sigiriya. I was bound for the tea capital of the country, Hatton, and after a 90-minute drive to Anuradhapura and a 40-minute private seaplane trip, I was there by early afternoon.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT19=I was staying at the Castlereagh Bungalow Garden Suite within the Ceylon Tea Trails residence, which comprises a handful of restored planter\u2019s bungalows. Built in 1925 and set just over 4000 feet above sea level, the view of the tea fields below and surrounding mountains was truly breathtaking. The revitalising smell of tea permeated throughout the suite as I unpacked the essentials, the multifaceted scents of different tea varieties trickling in through the windows as I cracked them open.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT20=After spending much of the day sitting down in transit, I was anxious to stretch my legs and explore the area. I learnt from the butler that I could take in the scenery along the mountain slopes via bike, which were at the guests\u2019 disposal in every bungalow. For longer rides, it was recommended to take a resident tour guide along, but I wasn\u2019t planning to be gone too long as the clouds were starting to gather, so I decided to venture out on my own.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT21=It was hard to keep my eyes on the path when the gorgeous scenery in my peripheral vision screamed for attention. Having ridden for a little under an hour, I stopped at a particularly stunning spot and watched the rain in the distance envelop a valley below. I figured that, if I turned back now, I had enough time to make my descent before the clouds made their way to me.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT22=On my return to the bungalow, I replaced the rain beginning to fall outside for a revitalizing walk-in rain shower. With all meals and drinks included in the nightly rate, I headed to pre-dinner cocktails and joined the party of a charming British couple and their three-year-old daughter, who had invited me over after noticing my accent as I ordered a drink. The four-course gourmet dinner was enjoyed in their company (which, after skipping lunch, was exactly what I needed), and as the sounds of clanging cutlery and convivial conversation evaporated into the night, I thought of nothing but the brilliance of the moment.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT23=My day started with \u2018Bed Tea\u2019, served by my butler as a pleasant wake-up call, after which he customarily drew me a bath. Today was all about tea, though I quickly discovered that the food was taken as seriously as the tea here. 
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT24=The restaurant offered full English or Sri Lankan breakfast, so endeavouring to experience the full range of the country\u2019s flavours, I opted for the latter. A mouth-watering assortment was laid before me: chicken curry, dahl (lentil curry), egg hoppers (savoury pancakes with a fried egg in the centre), pol sambol (a condiment made from grated coconut and chilli) and roti (flatbread) to mop it all up with.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT25=I\u2019d arranged with my last night\u2019s dinner company to go on the guided Tea Experience tour together, only a short 10-minute trip from the Castlereagh Bungalow. Starting at 10:30am and finishing up around midday, the resident Tea Planter took us through the tea manufacturing process, how different tea flavours are created and how the early colonial settlers lived. Some of the methodology and machinery used to make the tea are over a century old, which just goes to show how things used to be built to last.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT26=Following an afternoon cream tea back at the residence consisting of scones, clotted cream, jams, cakes and sandwiches (and tea, of course), I met up with the family again for a game of croquet in the brick-flanked gardens. Sipping on a Pimms No 1 in those moments when the playing mallet rested at my side, the afternoon turned to dusk in the blink of an eye.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT27=After my Bed Tea and bath (I was getting dangerously used to this already), I went on a brief walk around the grounds before another filling breakfast. The day\u2019s main activity was a toss up between white water rafting and kayaking. The former involved a 90-minute drive, which swayed my decision in favour of kayaking on the much closer Castlereagh Lake, visible from the bungalow.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT28=Having paddled for a good hour or so, I pulled up at the shore, rays of sunshine piercing the early afternoon clouds as I disembarked. Before I\u2019d left on my solo journey around the lake, I\u2019d asked for a gourmet packed lunch to take with me (in lieu of the 3-course lunch or Sri Lankan rice and curry) to enjoy at a spot just like this. Absolute bliss.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT29=With my muscles and joints well-used, it was only natural that I take advantage of the Tea Trails Signature Massage. To my welcome surprise, the masseuse came straight to my door and set the table up in the comfort of my suite. Talk about room service!
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT30=It was my final night at the enchanting residence, and after another evening spent in great company, I bid goodbye to the new friends I\u2019d made with a refreshing Ceylon Arrack (a spirit made from the sap of the coconut flower) and ginger beer. Cheers!
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT31=The last Bed Tea, bath and breakfast went all too quickly. It was time to make my way to the iconic Yala National Park, first by a half-hour trip by seaplane and then about an hour by car. Here, I swapped the colonial bungalows for the luxurious Chena Huts by Uga Escapes, which blended a hut-like exterior with a modern, island-inspired interior.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT32=The huts were unbelievably tranquil; birds sang their songs from up in the tropical trees, accompanied by the soft hum of various insects, and with only fourteen cabins on the seven-acre property, it felt as if you were completely alone. The day wasn\u2019t overly hot, but after all the baths in Hatton, I thought I\u2019d take a dip in the plunge pool, which was built into the outdoor deck of my hut and naturally private, courtesy of the surrounding foliage.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT33=Having skipped lunch (again), the first sign of twilight beckoned me towards The Basses restaurant, which took the meaning of \u2018al fresco\u2019 to a whole new level. I was given the option to have my seafood platter under the stars or by the beach beside a bonfire, ultimately choosing to feel the sand under my feet. Stunning views of the inky ocean accompanied my meal as the moon ascended, its pale light dissolving in the gently crashing waves.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT34=Following breakfast the next morning, I embarked on a whale-and-dolphin watching expedition departing from Mirissa organised at the reception, which involved a 2.5-hour drive from the hut. Despite the drive, it was well worth it.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT35=According to the guide, it was a little early in the season to spot our prime sightseeing target \u2014 the blue whale \u2014 but not impossible. Not long after pulling away from the shore, we could already see dolphins jumping not far from the boat. A promising sign, apparently.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT36=It was only as we were heading back that we were lucky enough to sneak a glimpse of a big blue behemoth leaping in the distance, around a kilometre or so away. Even from that distance, the imposing size of the mammal was clearly visible, so it was with a little sigh of relief that we returned to shore without the boat tipping from any further encounters.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT37=Whale watching the day before had left me exhausted, so I spent most of the day on the sun lounge on the deck of my hut with a book, occasionally dipping my toes in the cool water. I did leave the hut to have the included lunch since I wouldn\u2019t be there for dinner, as I\u2019d booked in an evening game drive.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT38=As dusk rolled around, I climbed into the back of the safari jeep to see what nocturnal creatures we could spy waking up around Yala National Park. The park is home to the highest density of leopard population in the world, so no prizes for guessing which animal stole the show.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT39=Through the use of infrared and night-vision goggles, which not only helped us see significantly more detail but also helped limit the amount of artificial light the animals were exposed to, we observed the big cats in their natural habitat. We were even lucky enough to see the predators in action as one leopard slinked its way up a tree and plucked a bird from its nest. Not for the faint-hearted, but a remarkable demonstration of nature in action.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT40=After breakfast, it was back to where it all started: Colombo. On arrival, the staff at the hotel where I\u2019d stayed on my first night in Sri Lanka greeted me with familiarity, as if I\u2019d never left.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT41=Having spent the last nine days in such remote parts of the country, I decided to explore a bit of the city. It felt strange to be among the skyscrapers and bustling streets again. In truth, it felt like significantly more time had passed, given everything I\u2019d done and everywhere I\u2019d been.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT42=Tomorrow I\u2019d be leaving Sri Lanka to spend the second half of my trip in the Maldives \u2014 probably more relaxing, but definitely less fascinating. The trip so far was better than I could\u2019ve hoped for. The rich history, vibrant culture, welcoming people and spectacular wildlife had all been a joy to experience, and I hoped to be back one day to visit the parts of the country I hadn\u2019t been able to squeeze in this time around.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT43=My flight to the Maldives awaited, so it was back to the familiar terminals of Colombo Airport following one last Sri Lankan breakfast. After arriving in the island\u2019s capital, Mal\u00E9, I was transported by seaplane to the One&Only Reethi Ran Resort, which sprawls across its very own island. 
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT44=The water villa in which I was staying oozed class: high ceilings, an oversized bathtub and a huge deck complete with a couple of hammocks \u2014 perfect for sunbathing over the crystal-clear lagoon. I had timed my visit with a few colleagues, who had also chosen to vacation on the island, so it was a nice change of pace to see some familiar faces.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT45=The next ten days blurred into one another, a leisurely combination of relaxation and light activities. And believe me when I say there was no shortage of things to do: twelve beaches, eight restaurants, a dive and watersports centre, sun spa, beach club, climbing wall, golf simulator, artists\u2019 studio, luxury boutique, library and two tennis courts dotted the island \u2014 and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed at least a thing or two.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT46=On the second-last day of my stay I think it was, as I was dozing off in the hammock that had become my cocoon for the day, I spied two bright-beaked birds wrestling for a worm, one of which was slightly bigger than the other. My mind drifted to King Kashyapa and his brother, vying for the throne on that great big lion rock, and I wondered whether Sri Lanka would\u2019ve been much different today had things gone the other way.
INSPIRATION_POST2_CONTENT47=I\u2019d never know which of the birds won the tussle for the worm, for I was quickly swayed to sleep, and soon enough I was right where my mind had left off: atop an armoured elephant, spear in hand, charging into the thick of battle.

INSPIRATION_POST3_SUB_TITLE8=Couples Retreat \u2013 Thursday 12 November
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT1=Our trip began on Qatar airlines with, in my opinion, some well-deserved drinks. The week had been long and I was excited to see anything except another cement city. I ordered a whiskey; my girlfriend, elegant as she is, opted for a glass of sparkling. We figured our first day was mainly for getting acquainted with the camp, and if we happened to do that tipsy, great! 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT2=When we got off the plane at Kilimanjaro International, we were welcomed with an all-too-familiar sensation: a COVID test tickling our brains and some customs paperwork. The price we pay for travel these days.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT3=I complain, but the whole ordeal was over in less than ten odd minutes, and as soon as it was, we were whisked away to our next flight (this time, fully private). The \u201CPilatus\u201D, they called her \u2014 a goddamn beautiful plane. Crafted in Switzerland, leather seats, hardwood cabinetry, the whole shebang. Never thought I\u2019d say this, but I wish I was on that plane longer.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT4=The trip was just shy of an hour or so, and when we landed, our driver/tour guide was there waiting for us. Nice guy, very enthusiastic. Said he\u2019d been working as a guide for a decade plus and I quickly believed him \u2014 there wasn\u2019t a question we had that he couldn\u2019t answer. Turns out hippos don\u2019t actually swim, they sink to the bottom of the river and walk on the riverbed floor.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT5=When we got to the camp, I was floored. Admittedly, I didn\u2019t handle the bookings, so when my girlfriend told me we were staying at a \u201Ccamp\u201D, I didn\u2019t expect to see a king bed, an infinity pool and, I kid you not, a microbrewery. I promptly picked up my jaw and we explored the surroundings. It had all the trappings of modern comfort but with the occasional giraffe sauntering by.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT6=The staff took our bags and gave us a tour of our \u201Ctent\u201D. And by tent I mean multi-roomed, high-ceilinged, mahogany-floored, painting-ladened, open-floor-planned, indoor-outdoor tent. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it still felt as if we were on safari \u2014 having the plains on your doorstep really seems to help with that \u2014 but it was nice knowing we could have a hot shower at night and connect to the Wi-Fi, too. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT7=By this point we were getting a little peckish, so the camp\u2019s staff prepared us a miniature buffet. We ate al fresco style on our private shaded veranda before deciding what to do with the rest of our day. Eventually, we opted for cocktails in the pool to cool off from the midday heat. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT8=Whatever my expectations were, I\u2019m very glad I was wrong. There\u2019s something surreal about lounging in a pool, a genuinely well-designed pool you would see at any 5-star hotel, except you look to your left and there\u2019s an elephant 50 meters off. Something you quite literally would never see in a big city.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT9=Several very well spent hours later, we reconvened for a three-course dinner on the terrace to dine under the stars. We had a big day and an early morning tomorrow, so we retired for the evening.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT10=We started the day off bright and early with fresh coffee delivered to our tent. We planned on going out on the early morning game drive, so we couldn\u2019t stay for breakfast, but it was well worth it. Within minutes of being out on the plains, we saw our first big cat off in the distance: an adult male lion lying on the grass. We were a little hesitant at first to go up to it (on account of its giant claws), but our tour guide assured us it was safe. We approached slowly and carefully until it was a few metres from the truck, the two of us still very cautious. As it turns out, lions are very lazy creatures when not actively hunting. He just layed there, occasionally yawning or, as my girlfriend put it, \u201Cposing for us\u201D. We spent a good while admiring him, but ultimately decided to let him be and go find some more energetic animals.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT11=Now, if lions are lazy, hyenas are adventurous. We drove some distance before stopping for a break in the shade. Not five minutes later we had a pack of fifteen or so come up to us. They stayed at a distance in the beginning, but once they felt more comfortable, they came closer to the truck. A number of them came up and started sniffing the dusty wheels. Keep in mind hyenas are roughly the size of a big dog, and having that many crowd around you can be a little disconcerting to say the least. So although the hyenas felt comfortable, our tour guide took control of the situation and we were off. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT12=After we were a safe distance away, our guide asked us when we wanted to stop for breakfast and we told him we didn\u2019t bring any. We were delighted to hear that the staff had actually packed a small picnic for us and stored it in the 4\u00D74\u2019s mini fridge. I don\u2019t know if it was because I wasn\u2019t expecting it, but that may have been the juiciest, most refreshing fruit I have ever tasted.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT13=On our drive back to the camp, we went past the Mara River in hopes of catching the crossing of the wildebeest. We were in luck! When we arrived, we were graced with the sight of hundreds of wildebeest crossing the Maya, but boy were they not graceful. They weren\u2019t crossing so much as racing. And as our tour guide pointed out, those aren\u2019t logs in the river. From just the relatively small herd we saw, let\u2019s just say two went down and didn\u2019t come back up. The tour guide reminded us it was the circle of life, and told us it was actually good for the river. Those wildebeest will feed not just the crocodiles, but the birds, the fish, the plants, and all of the Mara. And it was a spectacular show to see, if not a touch morbid. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT14=We welcomed in November from above \u2014 about 500 meters above. With another early a.m. start, we were collected from the camp and taken to our main experience for the day: a hot air-balloon ride. And it was an experience. We were there when the balloon was inflating and ushered in just as the sun was beginning to breach the horizon. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT15=Finally off the ground, we caught a glimpse of a small herd of a distinctly black-and-white animal in the distance. While ascending, the wind began to carry us gently in its direction. The closer we got, the bigger it seemed. But it was not until we were overhead that we could truly appreciate the size of the herd. The pilot estimated there were 400-500 below.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT16=So there we were, floating above the sunkissed Serengeti, taking in a once-in-a-lifetime view and what do we see below? The staff beginning to set up for breakfast. All before 10am. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT17=Another destination, another Pilatus flight. We were transferred to the Kogatende airstrip for our next great adventure, starting (as all good trips do) via private plane. Destination: Zanzibar. COVID test: not required.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT18=But it wasn\u2019t Zanzibar itself that we were interested in. No, we were going somewhere a few kilometres off it \u2014 Mnemba Island. A private, whitesand tropical paradise, palm trees and all.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT19=We stayed at the island\u2019s lodge, fittingly called Mnemba Island Lodge. The lodge is known for its exclusivity, and justifiably so. There are only twelve bandas on the island, each tucked away in their own private patch of tropical foliage. I can\u2019t speak for the others, but ours was made of woven palm mat, complete with a veranda and truly sensational ocean view. To say we had the beach on our doorstep would be an understatement \u2014 the sand was but a single step outside. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT20=On our very first night there, the staff had set up a candlelit dining experience for us down by the ocean. We watched the sun set over the water, no city in sight. Naturally, we had a selection of the island\u2019s own seafood and topped it off with some very imported champaign.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT21=The next day was gorgeous, with not a single cloud in the sky. Our agenda consisted of exactly one item: snorkeling. On our dive down, we truly got to appreciate the colours and textures of the reef. The magnificent golds and vibrant magentas, the hard rocks and ethereal polyps. We even made a friend! A green sea turtle that was, for the record, far bigger than I had imagined. Apparently, the island is a protected nesting ground for green sea turtles, so not only are they common, they aren\u2019t afraid of divers. And here I was, thinking that we had a connection. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT22=If Saturday was all about going in the water, today was all about staying out of it. We decided today was about relaxation, starting with breakfast in bed. The staff brought us a selection of tropical fresh fruit, muesli, a bakery basket, homemade jams, and freshly squeezed juice. Before we began, the chef visited us to chat about today\u2019s menu, though he stressed it was only a suggestion, and that they\u2019re flexible with incorporations and substitutions. We told him nothing of the sort would be necessary and that we trusted him completely. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT23=For lunch, we chose a private table nestled in a clearing. We selected the three-course meal and put ourselves in the chef\u2019s capable hands. He brought out a handful of ingredients and prepared for us a traditional Zanzibari spicy dip right there at the table. Enjoyed alongside fresh bread, it was an excellent start to the meal. The chef followed up with a butternut squash and walnut plate, served with heirloom tomatoes and plated on three distinct stripes of sauces. The main course was the catch of the day: pan-roasted local kingfish served with lemon, capers and crouton butter sauce. We ended the lunch with the perfect touch of sweetness \u2014 homemade mixed berry sorbet topped with fresh fruit. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT24=After a couple days of nothing but eating and lounging, my girlfriend and I woke up early and decided to see what the island had to offer. She went to beach yoga while I prepared for kayaking. I opted for the solo adventure as opposed to the guided tour so I could meander along to my heart\u2019s content. The sun on my back felt heavenly, and whenever I got too warm, I cooled off in the Pacific. Back in the banda, it was breakfast time. Omelettes were today\u2019s special and we had them alongside mimosas under the trees. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT25=We ticked off green sea turtles earlier in the week, but we wanted to see dolphins before the trip was over, so we decided to go on the boat trip. We were told dolphins were pretty common around here, though there\u2019d been no sign of them all week, so we didn\u2019t like our chances. Lo and behold, over an hour later \u2014 yeah, no such luck. The captain turned the boat around and we headed back to shore. We were a little disappointed but had still thoroughly enjoyed our time out on the water. Plus, nothing a few commiseratory cocktails on the beach couldn\u2019t solve.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT26=We decided that the last day of our holiday before returning back to shoe-wearing society should be a couples day. We requested two half servings of pancakes and waffles with berries, as well as in-banda wellness treatments. By the time we had finished our breakfast, our two masseuses had arrived at our proverbial door. We welcomed them in, and with them, an hour of hot stone relaxation. 
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT27=After a shower to rinse off the products, we quickly got redressed and joined the spice tour, driven deep into the island \u2014 well off the beach and into the greenery. We learned about the island\u2019s history as spice growers and got to experience vanilla and cinnamon, straight from the source.
INSPIRATION_POST3_CONTENT28=We ended the day with the sunset show cruise, sharing a bottle of bubbly as the sky went from pink hues to burning orange, with slashes of deep indigo and azure before finally descending into inky black. And what did we see in the gleaming moonlight? Dolphins.
