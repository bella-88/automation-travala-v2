EXPLORE_NFT_PAGE_QUESTION5=What marketing tasks will I have to perform?
EXPLORE_NFT_PAGE_ANSWER1=No two Travel Tiger NFTs are the same. Using a randomly generated algorithm ensures the uniqueness of each piece. The traits vary in rarity, and include different fur colours, outfits, eyes, facial expressions, earrings, necklaces and backgrounds.
EXPLORE_NFT_PAGE_ANSWER2=1,000 Founders Edition Travel Tiger NFTs will be minted. 900 of these will be sold during the private sale and 100 will be retained in the treasury for marketing, promotion and future funding of the program.
EXPLORE_NFT_PAGE_ANSWER3=As Travala.com grows, so too will the Smart Diamond membership in order to expand the reach of the ambassador community. Built on the core principle of decentralization, this “Support-to-earn” model will benefit Travala.com by enlisting dedicated community members to help drive platform growth, which in turn will benefit ambassadors by growing the rewards pool.
EXPLORE_NFT_PAGE_ANSWER4=Yes, the Ambassador Bonus pool contributions are fixed, and the bonus pool will be replenished quarterly as long as it is possible to do so, subject always to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and force majeure.
EXPLORE_NFT_PAGE_ANSWER5=NFT holders will be required to perform a simple marketing task each quarter to claim their share of the ambassador bonus rewards. These tasks will only need to be performed once each quarter, after the ambassador bonus allocations for that quarter have been announced. Upon completion of the task, NFT holders will automatically receive their reward travel credits.

AVA_TOKEN_PAGE_FAQS_QUESTION4=How can I earn AVA?
AVA_TOKEN_PAGE_FAQS_ANSWER1=Hotel loyalty points are limited in their application and are generally only redeemable for hotel bookings, room upgrades, and other bonuses within a particular hotel chain or group. Because AVA has a real market value determined by supply and demand, AVA provides you with the freedom to book any stay, flight, activity or package on Travala.com, purchase goods and services, or trade it for another currency.
AVA_TOKEN_PAGE_FAQS_ANSWER2=The primary utility of the AVA token is its function as an efficient and global value transfer tool for the purchase of travel products on Travala.com without foreign currency conversion fees. The extent of AVA’s use cases grows through the addition of new travel products to the Travala.com platform and the adoption of AVA as a payment method on other platforms, adding value to the entire AVA network.
AVA_TOKEN_PAGE_FAQS_ANSWER3=No. Each hotel booking made on Travala.com will receive up to 2% giveback in the form of AVA tokens, regardless of your payment method or AVA balance. In order to receive this giveback, you only need to have a Travala.com account. The giveback will be credited directly to your account wallet after you complete your stay at the property.
AVA_TOKEN_PAGE_FAQS_ANSWER4=There are a number of ways to earn AVA without directly purchasing the token. The Invite Program offers US$25 in AVA to you and anyone you refer who successfully registers for a Travala.com account and makes an eligible booking. If you have a website or social media presence, you can also consider becoming an Affiliate Partner or Influencer Partner, both of which distribute commissions in AVA.
